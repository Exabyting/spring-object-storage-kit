### 3. Coverage Badge Update Script (`scripts/update-coverage-badge.sh`)

**Features:**

- ✅ Parses JaCoCo XML reports with proper type filtering
- ✅ Updates README badges for instruction, branch, and line coverage
- ✅ Color-coded badges (red < 50%, orange 50-79%, green ≥ 80%)
- ✅ Robust error handling with default values
- ✅ Support for missing coverage data edge cases

### 4. Workflow Validation Script (`scripts/validate-workflows.sh`)

**Features:**

- ✅ Comprehensive testing of all workflow components
- ✅ Validates Gradle build and test execution
- ✅ Checks coverage report generation
- ✅ Verifies badge update functionality
- ✅ YAML syntax validation

## 📋 Configuration Details

### JaCoCo Configuration (build.gradle)

```gradle
test {
    useJUnitPlatform()
    finalizedBy jacocoTestReport
}

jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.12"
}

jacocoTestReport {
    dependsOn test
    reports {
        xml.required = true
        html.required = true
        csv.required = false
    }
    finalizedBy jacocoTestCoverageVerification
}

jacocoTestCoverageVerification {
    violationRules {
        rule {
            limit {
                minimum = 0.80 // 80% minimum coverage
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### GitHub Actions Permissions

The workflows include proper permissions for:

- **contents: write** - For updating README badges and pushing changes
- **pages: write** - For deploying coverage reports to GitHub Pages
- **id-token: write** - For GitHub Pages authentication
- **pull-requests: write** - For commenting on PRs

## 🎯 Coverage Thresholds and Goals

- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% instruction coverage (enforced by Gradle)
- **Target Goals**:
    - Instruction Coverage: 80%+
    - Branch Coverage: 70%+
    - Line Coverage: 80%+

## 🏷️ Badge Color Coding

| Coverage Range | Color  | Badge Example                                                        |
|----------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0% - 49%       | Red    | ![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-45%25-red)         |
| 50% - 79%      | Orange | ![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-65%25-orange)      |
| 80% - 100%     | Green  | ![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-95%25-brightgreen) |

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Repository Settings**:
    - Enable GitHub Actions
    - Enable GitHub Pages (source: GitHub Actions)
    - Grant write permissions to GITHUB_TOKEN

2. **Required Files**:
    - `build.gradle` with JaCoCo configuration
    - GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`
    - Coverage update script in `scripts/`

### Enabling GitHub Pages

1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Select "GitHub Actions" as the source
3. The coverage reports will be available at `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`

## 📊 Workflow Outputs

### Main Branch Workflow

- **Coverage Reports**: Deployed to GitHub Pages
- **Artifacts**: JaCoCo reports and test results
- **README Updates**: Automatic badge updates
- **Commit Comments**: Detailed coverage tables

### Pull Request Workflow

- **PR Comments**: Coverage summaries with change indicators
- **Status Checks**: Pass/fail based on coverage thresholds
- **Artifacts**: Coverage reports for review

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**:
    - Ensure GITHUB_TOKEN has write permissions
    - Check repository settings for Actions permissions

2. **Coverage Reports Not Found**:
    - Verify JaCoCo configuration in build.gradle
    - Check that tests are running successfully

3. **Badge Update Failures**:
    - Ensure the update script has execute permissions
    - Verify XML report format and location

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Run tests and generate coverage locally
./gradlew clean test jacocoTestReport

# Update coverage badges manually
bash scripts/update-coverage-badge.sh

# Validate all workflow components
bash scripts/validate-workflows.sh

# Check JaCoCo report structure
head -20 build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.xml
```

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Update Dependencies**: Keep GitHub Actions and tools updated
2. **Review Thresholds**: Adjust coverage requirements as needed
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check workflow execution times
4. **Validate Reports**: Ensure coverage data accuracy

### Updating Coverage Thresholds

To change coverage requirements:

1. Update `build.gradle` JaCoCo configuration
2. Modify badge color thresholds in `update-coverage-badge.sh`
3. Update documentation references

## 📈 Benefits

- **Automated Quality Assurance**: Continuous monitoring of test coverage
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time badge updates in README
- **Developer Experience**: Immediate feedback on PR coverage impact
- **Historical Tracking**: Coverage reports preserved in GitHub Pages
- **Zero Maintenance**: Fully automated with robust error handling

## 🎉 Success Metrics

The current setup achieves:

- ✅ **100% Automation**: No manual intervention required
- ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: Instruction, branch, and line metrics
- ✅ **Fast Feedback**: Coverage updates within minutes of commits
- ✅ **Reliable Reporting**: Robust error handling and validation
- ✅ **Developer Friendly**: Clear visual indicators and detailed reports
